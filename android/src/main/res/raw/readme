This file exists to list all remaining licenses in the header that are not already in use elsewhere. These can be Maven
libraries, for example. Based on the listing in the header, REUSE (download --all) will store the texts of the licenses
under <ROOT>/LICENSES/, from where a Gradle task delivers them for Android as a raw resource (in the "res (generated)"
folder). This prevents duplicate license texts in the repository.
