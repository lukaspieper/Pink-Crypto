# Pink-Crypto

Pink (stands for Password-[Tink](https://github.com/google/tink)) is a Android library
that extends the popular crypto library build by Google to support password based encryption
and decryption. It uses [Signal's Argon2 library](https://github.com/signalapp/Argon2) to 
derive a key from the password.
